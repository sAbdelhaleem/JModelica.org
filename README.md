# JModelica version 2.1
Simulations of the ![MultizoneVAV](../MultizoneVAV) testbed were implemented using JModelica version 2.1 textual simulation environment. Accordingly, this is the software repository for JModelica version 2.1 (r10720). 

For description of a customized procedure for compiling JModelica from sources on Ubuntu, please refer to ![Section 1 in the MultizoneVAV README file](../MultizoneVAV/MultizoneVAV%200.1.0/README.md). The original installation procedure is provided in *JModelica User Manual 2.1*, however, since the time the MultizoneVAV testbed was developed JModelica.org discontinued providing direct access to the user manual. The reader may refer to the installation procedure in *JModelica User Manual 2.2* at the following [link](https://jmodelica.org/downloads/UsersGuide.pdf).
