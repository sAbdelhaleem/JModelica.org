# JModelica.org version 2.1
Simulations of the [MultizoneVAV](../../../MultizoneVAV) testbed were implemented using JModelica.org version 2.1 (r10720) textual simulation environment. Accordingly, this software repository redistributes JModelica.org version 2.1 (r10720) without modification. 

For description of a customized procedure for compiling JModelica.org from sources on an Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS distribution, please refer to Section 1 of the README file in the [MultizoneVAV](../../../MultizoneVAV) repository. The original installation procedure is provided in *JModelica.org User Manual 2.1*. However, since the time the [MultizoneVAV](../../../MultizoneVAV) testbed was developed, JModelica.org discontinued providing direct access to the user manual. For the original installation procedure for the last public open source version of JModelica.org, the reader may refer to *JModelica.org User Manual 2.2* at <https://jmodelica.org/downloads/UsersGuide.pdf>.
